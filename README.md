## The architecture of the Library
I did use MVC(Model-View-Control) architecture, the main reason behind that i like ASP.net MVC than razor page, the MVC give me feeling of real seperation of the project 
which i worked on, Seperation not only in code put could spread the tasks across your entites to reach the elegent code you hope.
